     * @param swerve            The swerve drivebase subsystem.
     * @param vX                DoubleSupplier that supplies the x-translation joystick input.  Should be in the range -1
     * to 1 with deadband already accounted for.  Positive X is away from the alliance wall.
     * @param vY                DoubleSupplier that supplies the y-translation joystick input.  Should be in the range -1
     * to 1 with deadband already accounted for.  Positive Y is towards the left wall when
     * looking through the driver station glass.
     * @param headingHorizontal DoubleSupplier that supplies the horizontal component of the robot's heading angle. In the
     * robot coordinate system, this is along the same axis as vY. Should range from -1 to 1 with
     * no deadband.  Positive is towards the left wall when looking through the driver station
     * glass.
     * @param headingVertical   DoubleSupplier that supplies the vertical component of the robot's heading angle.  In the
     * robot coordinate system, this is along the same axis as vX.  Should range from -1 to 1
     * with no deadband. Positive is away from the alliance wall.
